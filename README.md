![image](https://github.com/Ajinkya-Adsule/Accenture-Technology-Consulting-Virtual-Internship-Job-Simulation-Forage/blob/45fb517708b1b49b5e8c3dbf032e95c5b08fdeda/Project%20Files/project%20intro.png)



About this in brief ,

Accenture Forage's Technology Consulting simulation provides a virtual, self-paced experience in technology consulting at Accenture. It's designed to give students and career changers a taste of the role, helping them gain skills and build their resumes for potential careers at Accenture. The program includes pre-recorded videos, example answers, and tasks that simulate real-world scenarios, covering areas like project kickoffs, stakeholder interviews, design collaboration, and Agile development. 

**Here is your task that you will have to complete for getiing certification and knowledge working as technology consulting analyst**


We have a unique opportunity presented to us by the Australian Federal Government, and we need your skills as a technology consultant to play a key role in this effort! We will be designing a web-based election system to be piloted internally at three federal agencies.  


In this task, we will simulate the project initiation phase of an Accenture technology design project. You will review two emails from the partner and assigned project manager that specify the high-level details, and you have been invited to a kickoff meeting (simulated) where you will introduce yourself to the team. To prepare for the kickoff meeting, you will create a 45-second video to introduce yourself to the team. Your video should include, at a minimum:



•	Your name and what you like to be called.
•	Education background
•	Areas of technology that you are particularly interested in
•	Your enthusiasm to join this project team.
After the kickoff, you will participate in a few design brainstorming sessions as you and the team prepare for the requirements analysis phase. To prepare for brainstorming, you are asked to perform some online research:


•	Conduct online research to see if you can find any existing public sector online voting systems.
•	Examine potential software as a service (SaaS) offerings; links to two of these are provided in the Resources section below.
There is no formal deliverable to submit on your research; just keep some internal notes. You will share this research in the next few team meetings as we prepare to formulate a high-level functional design and then engage with the client in the next task on requirements gathering.

New Project - Australian Federal Government - Online Voting Pilot 1 message Susan Smith<Susan.smith@accenture.com> To: AusFedOnlineVotingTeam Reginald and Team, Wed, Feb 15, 2023 at 12:44 PM We have a unique opportunity to get in front of a national initiative for electronic voting. Initially this will be focused on internal government agency support (councils, planning boards, legislature, etc.) and will be piloted within a specific agency (TBD). This is a great opportunity for our practice to develop an "online voting engine" that can later be augmented for public election support across Australia and beyond! This project is ours to design and will be funded, in part, by the federal government. All we have at this point are some very high-level "thoughts" from our project sponsor. I would like the team to brainstorm on this potential solution, come up with a high-level functional storyboard, and prepare for interviews that will support a more in-depth requirements analysis. From my notes to date, here are some of the key requirements as I understand them: • The system must be dynamic and support multiple concurrent votes by multiple agencies. • It should support online voting only – do not worry about integrating with other types of voting systems. • There must be a hyper secure voter maintenance module that accepts as input existing authorised user lists but also provides for self-registration and purging (i.e., death or reassignment). • Ballots should be dynamically created based on a secure ballot setup function. That function will also specify what roles can access the ballot, when, and for how long, and potentially support notification via text message. Ability for a user to change their vote before the period closes should be an option. • A voter portal should be created that shows the voter what ballots are available to them and allows them to select a ballot and vote. Secure authoridation is a key component; it must be beyond logon authorization. • Ballots should be data-driven without any hardcoding. Ballots must support multiple choice with write-in options, Yes/No/Abstain/No Vote, and list of priorities voting (i.e., score multiple selections from a list). • Security on all modules is the most important requirement, this includes secure user validation, internal security as well as security from potential outside hackers. Reginald will be the project manager. He and I have worked on several past projects, and he has extensive experience with this client. 
Best, Susan Smith

Hello everyone,
My name is Mr. Ajinkya Adsule, and I’m excited to be part of the kick-off meeting for Online Voting Pilot project at Accenture, I have joined the team as a Business Analyst.
I come from an academic background of an post graduate MBA with a dual specialization in IT and Project Management,  Previously   I have worked in US healthcare revenue cycle management sector for about 4.5 years ,this experience has equipped me with both strategic and technical perspectives essential for bridging the gap between business needs and technology solutions.
Over the years, I’ve developed a strong interest in emerging technologies, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and automation for process optimization. I’m passionate about leveraging data and smart systems to drive decision-making and efficiency in projects.
I’m really looking forward to working collaboratively with all of you. Let’s make this project a great success together!"

**Example Answer**
Great work! Take a look at the example script below to see one way you could have attempted your video introduction. Think about what you did well and how you can improve.

Accenture Australia Online Voting Project Task 1 Sample Answer
Video Introduction Script:

Hi, I’m Phillip Kurinsky, but you can call me Phil. I’m a technology analyst assigned to the project.

Originally from Newcastle, I attended the University of Technology here in Sydney and this is where I live
now. I earned my degree in computer science and interned for two years with Accenture while studying
before joining officially after graduation about two years ago.

I’ve been on some interesting projects and I really love our agile lifecycle methodology. I have learned
quite a bit on my first projects and developed a keen interest in both artificial intelligence and data
science. I participate in our internal communities for both topics.

I am really excited to join this team; it seems like a terrific opportunity that could lead to a mega project.
Seems like I am getting in on the ground floor and I hope it is a great ride!

Outside of work I love music, biking and surfing, and try to spend a lot of my time in the great outdoors.
I do stay in touch with my family in Newcastle and sometimes take the family dog on my adventures.

Great to meet all of you!

Here is the background information on your task
Looks like we have a great team!



During the project kickoff, we all got to meet each other and share our high-level thoughts based on Susan's initial vision and requirements for the online voting project. Thanks for your research and your participation in the design brainstorming session. Now that we have a "straw man" functional design for the online voting system, we can engage with the client in the requirements-gathering phase, but first, we need to do some preparation.


Requirements gathering comes in many forms, but the primary interactions with clients are:



Respond to questions given in an online survey form or an Excel spreadsheet.
Interview key project stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs).
Facilitate workshops with the core client team.
We have onboarded two client SMEs who will be part-time team members and also documented the initial requirements known so far. In preparation, each team member will now prepare a list of questions to facilitate the requirements-gathering sessions.


At this point, we have decided to take a divide-and-conquer approach and assign primary responsibility for functional components to individual team members. Your assignment is to own the functions associated with creating and executing online ballots. This does not mean you are not involved in other aspects of the requirements gathering and analysis; just that we expect you to focus on ballots and produce the deliverable sections for that functional area.


 

Here is the background information on your task
Now let’s fast forward and assume that the client interviews/working sessions are complete and that we have reviewed the requirements with the client stakeholders. All has gone quite well, and some additional requirements were added during the stakeholder review.
Note that the task is focused only on the ballot setup and maintenance functions since that is your assignment. In a real project, all of the requirements would be combined for client review, and the full team would participate in a review of the entire set of requirements. Also note that due to time limits in the task, the final requirements are not as detailed and numerous as they would be in a real project, but you should get the idea.

Based on the supplied requirements, the next phase is to move on to the design of the online voting application, and you will lead the effort for the ballot module, contributing to a more complete deliverable for client review. Your analysis and results might be more comprehensive and detailed than what we want to provide the stakeholder at this point, so we need to make sure that it can be understood by our stakeholders, who are mainly business focused. The project manager will give you a template and/or examples from prior projects as your starting point. Once you and your team members are ready, we will have a full-team working session to integrate all of the slides into a consistent story for client review.


You will be provided with the approved requirements spreadsheet and a PowerPoint template to fill in with your design details. A sample answer will also be provided.  
Also, note that we intend to follow an agile approach for the development of the application and/or implementation of the SaaS product; most of what we have done so far is Waterfall. So the requirements and design can (and will) be changed as we review completed functionality with the client during the build phase of our project.
